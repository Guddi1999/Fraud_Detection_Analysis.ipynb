# Fraud_Detection_Analysis.ipynb
Developed a Fraud Detection Analysis model using machine learning techniques to identify anomalous transaction patterns.

Utilized Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to preprocess data, engineer features, and implement classification models Random Forest). Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to minimize false positives and improve fraud detection accuracy.


Observations and Key Insights-
The Number of Transactions in the Last 24 Hours is a key indicator of fraudulent activity.
A high transaction frequency within a short period often signals suspicious behavior, making it one of the most critical features in fraud detection.
Random Forest feature importance analysis confirms that this attribute significantly impacts model predictions, highlighting its value in identifying fraudulent transactions. ðŸš€

Features taken into accountability:
1. Past Fraudulent Behaviour
2. Count of Transactions in the last 24 hours
3. Payment Method
4. Fraud (Traget Feature)
